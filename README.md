Weather Forecast
The app provides forecasts for temperature, humidity, and wind speed based on the uploaded data.

Temperature Forecast
The temperature forecast is based on a pre-trained temperature regression model.

Humidity Forecast
The humidity forecast is based on a pre-trained humidity regression model.

Wind Speed Forecast
The wind speed forecast is based on a pre-trained wind speed regression model.

Predicted Weather Condition
The predicted weather condition is determined using a classifier model. The app displays the predicted weather condition in big block letters.
